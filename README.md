Beginning whit the main html,could see acouple of button for the others html(secundary pages)and so,the buttons of whatapps,e-mail,,instagram
that are complete funtionals.
in the css,could see a gradient(if you change the degrees of that gradient)you'll see how goes changing the colors(is not animated)
in the css1,you'll see,besides of the button of return for the main page,a figured out photograpies of the work that our client realizes.
inthe following css2,is almost the same,just have to change the photoggrapies
hope you like it
